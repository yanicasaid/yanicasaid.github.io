    title: About
    summary:
        I am a member of the 2023-2024 <a href="https://www.vrtx.com/careers/career-growth-and-opportunities/vertex-fellows/e">Vertex Fellows</a> cohort at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, with a keen interest in using mathematics, statistics, and AI to facilitate the drug discovery process. 
        I earned a collaborative PhD from the Department of Mathematics at the University of Malta 
        and the  <a href="https://mudshark.brookes.ac.uk/Home">Cell Systems Modeling Group</a> at Oxford Brookes University in 2023, where I applied Linear Algebra and Optimization techniques to develop mathematical tools and algorithms that predict metabolic behaviour and uncover emergent relationships in metabolic networks.
